# Component - Tab

The tab component is a functional component that works with the tab container component. It has no state and 3 props that manage the active class, label, and an onClick function passed to it.

It uses button markup under the hood for native keyboard focus and because it causes a change on the page and is not a link to navigate away from the page.

Below is the link to the file that powers this component.
