# Component - Button

The button component is functional and includes 0 pieces of state and 4 props.

The label prop is the string that will appear inside the button and is required for this component. This may change in time to accomodate scripted buttons that don't need a label string.

There is an onClick prop that expects function.

Out of the gate it is a standard button type and will need the `submitButton` boolean if used for form submissions.

Under the hood it is using the Pure CSS library for canned styles.
It has a primaryStyle option which is a boolean prop.

Below is the link to the file that powers this component.
