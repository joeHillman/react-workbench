# Component - Modal Portal

The modal portal component is the same Modal component but wrapped using a React Portal. Portals make this modal a true modal where it would be rendered at the root of the application and independent of where it was housed in the DOM. This particular implementation could be improved for accessibility but shows the use of React Portal.

Below is the link to the file that powers this component.
