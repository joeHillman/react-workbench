# Demonstration - Staff List Paginated - Basic

The demonstration is to show the pagination components in use with a data object that is first sized by the desired page size and is then mapped over and return the JSX to be rendered.

The data object here includes a list of staff in a restaurant and lists out names, positions, and if they're clocked in.

This is a basic demonstration and a secondary demonstration will be done later using RenderProps to leverage code reuse and future enhancements could include a filter to show clocked in/out employees.

Below is the link to the file that powers this component.
