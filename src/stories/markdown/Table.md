# Component - Table

The table component is functional and includes 0 pieces of state and 2 props.
The DATA prop is an array of objects, the headers is an array of strings and is required. There is no plan currently to derive the headers from the object keys and is left for the downstream author to decide.

Two map functions ultimately drive this component to accept any number of data objects in the received array.
