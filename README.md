# A React Workbench

[Portfolio and Finished Pieces](https://joehillman.github.io/react-workbench/)

This project is a place where I can actively develop and experiment with React JS.
The goal is to showcase and notate work that involves React and some pieces may still be under active development while others been promoted to the Storybook build for portfolio purposes and other pieces may be experimental or just a place to capture thoughts and concepts.

Feel free to poke around the codebase or go straight to the [portfolio](https://joehillman.github.io/react-workbench/).

The project has been bootstrapped with Create React App and has been ejected for the sake of SCSS compilation.
